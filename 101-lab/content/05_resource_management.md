# Resource Requests and Limits
Tuning the resources assigned to a pod will have a direct effect on the performance of the application.

Many templates include reasonable CPU and Memory resource configurations. However, new apps are deployed with the platform default resource configuration.

The platform default resource configuration is maintained by the Platform Services team. It is based on a measurement of average CPU and memory utilization, and it serves as a great starting point for your pod's horsepower.

## Explore Default Resource Configurations
Since the Rocket.Chat application was built from scratch and not deployed from a template, explore the current resources allocated to the pods:

- Navigate to your rocketchat deployment and select the YAML tab

- Take a look a the resources spec under `.spec.template.spec.containers.resources`. These values should reflect the resource requests (cpu=500m,memory=512Mi) and limits (cpu=1000m,memory=1024Mi) we set earlier. If we had not set any values for requests or limits earlier, we would see `{}` in the resources spec to indicate the deployment was using the default resource allocation for the platform.

- To view the limit ranges that are in place, run the command:
`oc get LimitRange`

- You should see there is a limit range in place called 'default-limits'. This set of request and limit values are applied when resource specifications are not defined. To view the details of this limit range, run:
`oc -n [-dev] describe LimitRange default-limits`

- Review the current metrics of your `rocketchat-[username]` pod. Navigate to your Deployment and then select the Pods tab to see a list of pods in your Deployment. Navigate to your pod by clicking its name and then select the Metrics tab to see your current pod metrics.

- Reduce the CPU (request and limit) to `65 millicores` and Memory (request and limits) to `100 Megabytes` and monitor the startup time of the pod
  ```oc:cli
  oc -n [-dev] set resources deployment/rocketchat-[username] --requests=cpu="65m",memory="100Mi" --limits=cpu="65m",memory="100Mi"
  ```
- Monitor the startup events of your pod and measure the time it takes to start. We'll restart the rollout and wait for that to finish to ensure all our pods are running with the new resources and that any old ones have finihsed shutting down after the last step. This will give us a consistent starting point to time from.   
  ```oc:cli
  # Restart deployment; and observe
  oc -n [-dev] rollout restart deployment/rocketchat-[username]

  # Wait for deployment to finish
  time oc -n [-dev] rollout restart deployment/rocketchat-[username]
  ```

You may notice your pod starts to crash loop. This is most likely because the `liveness` probe you added from an earlier lab is timing out. This is an important consideration when deciding to tune pod resources. It is always a balance.

- Remove the limits previously imposed, and set your pod to `1 core` (or `1000 millicores`) for the request and limit
  ```oc:cli
  oc -n [-dev] set resources deployment/rocketchat-[username] --requests=cpu="1000m",memory="512Mi" --limits=cpu="1000m",memory="1024Mi"
  ```

- Monitor the startup events of your pod and measure the time it takes to start. Again, we'll restart the rollout and wait for that to finish to ensure all our pods are running with the new resources and that any old ones have finished shutting down after the last step. This will give us a consistent starting point to compare to our previous timing. 
  ```oc:cli
  # Start new deployment; and
  oc -n [-dev] rollout restart deployment/rocketchat-[username]

  # Wait for deployment to finish
  time oc -n [-dev] rollout restart deployment/rocketchat-[username]
  ```

## Sharing Resources

If there are many team members (and therefore workloads) working together in the same namespace there is a chance that requesting 1 core of cpu and 1 core of memory will not work. Why could that be?

- Reset resources utilization to something more appropriate

```oc:cli
oc -n [-dev] set resources deployment/rocketchat-[username] --requests=cpu="150m",memory="256Mi" --limits=cpu="200m",memory="400Mi"
```

## Troubleshooting OOM

The dreaded `OOM` or Out of Memory is when your pods are utilizing less memory than is required for the containers inside of the pod to work. Often there are __no logs__ visible during these issues. Often the symptoms of OOM are `CrashLoopBackOff` failure events as well as `rollout` failures. These can be investigated in the `Events` panel. To resolve this you can first increase memory utilization. After that you should investigate if the memory utilization fix is a band-aid or not. In other words, is the application consuming more memory than it should.
