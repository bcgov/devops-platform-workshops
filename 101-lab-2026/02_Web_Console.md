# Web console

The web console is one way we can interact with OpenShift. You can log in using your login credentials. 

Each clusters has its own login page in the format: 
`https://console.apps.$CLUSTERNAME.devops.gov.bc.ca` 

In this training, we'll use the the Gold cluster, so the link is: 

https://console.apps.gold.devops.gov.bc.ca


## Log in, view your namespace

- Log in to the gold cluster using your IDIR account

- Explore resources available in web console (explore network policy?)
